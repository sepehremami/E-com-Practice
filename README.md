### Scenario: E-Commerce Website for Tech Gadgets

#### User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to browse through a list of tech gadgets available on the website.
2. As a user, I want to view details of a specific product.
3. As a user, I want to add products to my cart.
4. As a user, I want to view my cart and proceed to checkout.
5. As a user, I want to leave reviews for products I've purchased.
6. As an admin, I want to manage products (CRUD operations).
7. As an admin, I want to view and moderate product reviews.

#### Technologies to be Practiced:
- Django REST Framework
- JavaScript (for frontend interactivity)
- Redis (for caching product data)
- Celery (for asynchronous tasks like sending confirmation emails)
- Django ORM (for database operations)

#### Implementation Details:

1. **Django Models:**
   - Product: Fields - id, name, description, price, stock_quantity, image_url
   - Cart: Fields - id, user (Foreign Key to User), products (ManyToMany relationship with Product), quantity
   - Review: Fields - id, product (Foreign Key to Product), user (Foreign Key to User), rating, comment

2. **API Endpoints:**
   - `/api/products/`: GET (list of products), POST (create new product)
   - `/api/products/<product_id>/`: GET (retrieve product details), PUT (update product), DELETE (delete product)
   - `/api/cart/`: GET (retrieve user's cart), POST (add product to cart), DELETE (clear cart)
   - `/api/cart/checkout/`: POST (process checkout)
   - `/api/reviews/`: POST (create review)
   - `/api/reviews/<review_id>/`: GET (retrieve review details), PUT (update review), DELETE (delete review)

3. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - Use JavaScript to asynchronously load product details, add products to cart, and submit reviews without page reloads.
   - Implement a responsive UI to enhance user experience.

4. **Redis Integration:**
   - Cache frequently accessed product data to reduce database queries and improve performance.

5. **Celery Integration:**
   - Implement asynchronous tasks such as sending confirmation emails upon successful checkout.

#### Practice Tasks:

1. **Backend Tasks:**
   - Create Django REST Framework serializers and views for CRUD operations on products and reviews.
   - Configure URL routing for the API endpoints.

2. **Frontend Tasks:**
   - Design and implement UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Use Javascript(fetch, AJAX, axious) to interact with the Django REST API for fetching product details, adding/removing products from the cart, and submitting reviews.

3. **Redis and Celery Tasks:**
   - Integrate Redis for caching product data.
   - Configure Celery for asynchronous tasks like sending confirmation emails.
   - Implement Celery tasks for sending emails asynchronously upon successful checkout.

4. **Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test API endpoints using tools like Postman or Django Rest Framework's built-in testing framework.
   - Debug and fix any issues that arise during development.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the API endpoints, frontend functionality, and integration of Redis and Celery in the project.

By following this scenario, you can gain practical experience in building a full-fledged e-commerce website using Django REST Framework, JavaScript, Redis, and Celery, while also reinforcing your understanding of these technologies through hands-on practice.
